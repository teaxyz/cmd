# tea/cmd

Forks of this repository will be surfaced automatically to tea/cli as supplemental functionality.

Initially what you can do may be limited. Almost certainly the user will
have to confirm that are ok with us installing your tea/cmd before we do it.
Likely we will require additional security guarantees from you.


## script or command?

There is some overlap for sure which can make it hard to know if your
idea should be a tea/cmd or just a tea-script. In general weâ€™d say if
your idea is just inputs and outputs, then itâ€™s should be a script.

Commands (generally) will write to `~/.tea` or utilize installed
packages in some way.
